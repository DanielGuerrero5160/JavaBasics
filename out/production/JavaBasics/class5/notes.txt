Logical operators:
! || &&
Not is !-This will change a boolean variable to its opposite
 System.out.println(!true); This is false
 Not Operator (!)
 Not is used to negate the boolean values if something is true, it will make it false
 if something is false, it will make it true
 Why should we use logical operators?
 We can greatly simplify the logic using these operators
 (prevents some need for nested if,
 but less customizable as nested if)
 What is the Syntax:
 They only work with boolean data type
 if(! condition)
 if(condition1 ||condition2)
 if(condition1&&condition2)

 Whats is a switchCase statement:
 They are just another way of achieving same result as if-else-if conditions
 they are exactly the same but switch case statements are a lot faster,
 more efficient, and easier to read

 Syntax of SwitchCase:
 String variable:
 switch(var){
 case 1:
 sout"1"
 break;
 }
 Switch case can not be used with boolean, double,
 They will work with byte, short, int, char, String
 cannot use relational operators with switch chase (.,=+-)
